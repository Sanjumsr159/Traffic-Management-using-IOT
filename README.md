In rapidly urbanizing areas, traffic congestion and inefficient road management have become pressing challenges, impacting both the economy and the environment. 
This project proposes an innovative traffic management solution using the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance urban mobility. 
By deploying a network of smart sensors and devices, the system collects real-time data on traffic conditions, including vehicle density, speed, and type.
This data is processed to dynamically control traffic signals, prioritize emergency vehicles, and notify road users about current traffic conditions through a user-friendly interface. 
The integration of advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms enables predictive traffic management, improving the overall efficiency of urban transportation systems.
The proposed IoT-based solution is scalable, secure, and adaptable to different urban environments, paving the way for smarter and safer cities.
Technologies Used
IoT Sensors: For data collection (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, cameras, RFID tags).
Microcontrollers/Microprocessors: Such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi to interface with sensors.
